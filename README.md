Cypress E-commerce Automation Project
Introduction
This project is an automated test suite built using Cypress with the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. It is designed to automate the end-to-end testing for the TutorialsNinja e-commerce website, covering scenarios from user registration to the purchase of a T-shirt.

Features
The automation test suite includes the following features:

User Registration:
Automates the process of user sign-up on the TutorialsNinja website.
Verifies the successful registration and account creation.
Login and Authentication:
Tests the user login functionality.
Verifies correct handling of invalid login attempts.
Product Search and Selection:
Automates the search functionality to find a specific product (e.g., T-shirt).
Adds the selected product to the cart.
Product Purchase Flow:
Automates the end-to-end checkout process, including address selection and payment.
Verifies the order confirmation for successful purchases.
Logout:
Tests the logout functionality.
Design Decisions or Assumptions
Page Object Model (POM): Each page in the e-commerce workflow has a corresponding POM file to improve test organization and reusability.
Reusable Functions: Common actions such as login, logout, and product search are implemented as reusable functions to reduce redundancy.
Data-Driven Testing: Uses fixture files for test data, allowing easy modification and reusability for different test scenarios.
Installation & Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
Basic knowledge of Cypress and JavaScript.
Steps to Install
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Cypress-TutorialsNinja-POM.git
cd Cypress-TutorialsNinja-POM
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run Cypress

To open the Cypress Test Runner:
bash
Copy code
npx cypress open
To run tests in headless mode:
bash
Copy code
npx cypress run
Usage
Open Cypress Test Runner and run the test cases for end-to-end scenarios.
Modify fixtures files if you want to change test data (e.g., user details, product name).
Test results can be viewed in the Cypress Dashboard if connected.
Credentials
This project doesn’t include actual credentials; please replace any hardcoded data in fixture files with valid test data.
APIs Used
No external APIs are used in this project as it directly interacts with the UI of the TutorialsNinja website.
Technology Stack
Cypress: Automation testing framework.
JavaScript: Primary scripting language.
Page Object Model (POM): Design pattern to organize test cases.
File Descriptions
cypress/pages/: Contains page objects for each page involved in the e-commerce flow (e.g., registration page, login page, product page, checkout page).
cypress/e2e/: Contains test cases for each feature (e.g., user registration, login, purchase).
cypress/fixtures/: Contains JSON files with test data for user details, product information, etc.
Example Usage of Page Object Model (POM)
Each page class in cypress/pages/ encapsulates the elements and actions related to a particular page. For example:

javascript
Copy code
// registrationPage.js

class RegistrationPage {
    visit() {
        cy.visit('/register');
    }

    fillRegistrationForm(user) {
        cy.get('[data-test=first-name]').type(user.firstName);
        cy.get('[data-test=last-name]').type(user.lastName);
        cy.get('[data-test=email]').type(user.email);
        // More form fields
    }

    submitForm() {
        cy.get('[data-test=submit-button]').click();
    }
}

export default RegistrationPage;
Test Execution
Run All Tests:
bash
Copy code
npx cypress run
Run Specific Test:
bash
Copy code
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/registration.spec.js"
